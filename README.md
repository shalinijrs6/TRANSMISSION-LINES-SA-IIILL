# Introduction
In March 2025, the Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Trinetra in the challenging terrains of Arunachal Pradesh's Tawang Ridge. The mission aimed to intercept and neutralize hostile infiltrations using advanced RF communication systems. This case study delves into the RF engineering principles—impedance matching, guided wave propagation, and frequency parameter analysis—that were pivotal to the operation's success.

# Mission Overview
Location: Tawang Ridge, Arunachal Pradesh

Objective: Neutralize hostile infiltration via high-altitude surveillance

Technologies Deployed:

UHF/VHF radios for ground communication

Microwave Line-of-Sight (LOS) backhaul links

Fiber-guided RF signal boosters

Drone-mounted spectrum analyzers

# Impedance Matching (Smith Chart & Stubs)

# Reflection Coefficient
Γ=𝑍𝐿−𝑍0/𝑍𝐿+𝑍0
